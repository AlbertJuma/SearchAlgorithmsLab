# SearchAlgorithmsLab

I tried to develop a Python project that visualizes mazes and demonstrates AI search methods like **BFS**, **DFS**, and **A\***.  
It uses `matplotlib` to display the maze and paths clearly, helping beginners understand pathfinding techniques.

## Features
- Maze visualization
- BFS, DFS, and A* algorithms
- Simple and educational layout

## Requirements
- Python 3
- matplotlib

## Run
```bash
python maze_diagram.py
